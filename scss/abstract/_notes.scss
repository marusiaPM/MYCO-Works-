DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - main.CSS

-this project uses SASS

-main.CSS is a file compiled from all the partial SCSS files imported in the main.SCSS file. main.CSS SHOULD NEVER BE EDITED 

-Any changes, directly made in the main.CSS, will be overwritten every time the main.SCSS is compiled. 

-To implement any changes the partial files need to be edited (or new ones should be added) and then the main.SCSS should be compiled again.

-information about how to use SASS can be found here: https://sass-lang.com/guide
	
-if unable to use SASS a new CSS style sheet should be made main.CSS SHOULD NEVER BE EDITED
